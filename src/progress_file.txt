 Tasks :
 1) Get the relevant document from corpus in response
 to user query
    Algorithm:                                             Status
    based on Tf-Idf scores >>>                             Completed
    based on Synsets >>>                                   Pending

 2) Apply K-means algorithm on corpus to cluster
 documents into related groups
    Take set of documents >>>                              Completed
    Tokenize them and remove stopwords  >>>                Completed
    Generate document vectors  >>>                         Ongoing
        Construct a Tf-Idf matrix
    Implement a simple K-means >>>                         Completed
    Send the document matrix to K-means for clusering >>>  pending
